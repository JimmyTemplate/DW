        <h2>What Is Naive Bayes Algorithm In Machine Learning?
        </h2>
        <p>Consider a case where you have created features, you know about the importance of features and you are <br>
            supposed to make a classification model that is to be presented in a very short period of time? <br><br>



            What will you do? You have a very large volume of data points and very less few features in your data set.
            <br>
            In that situation if I had to make such a model I would have used ‘Naive Bayes’, that is considered to be a
            <br>
            really fast algorithm when it comes for classification tasks. <br><br>



            In this blog, I am trying to explain how the algorithm works that can be used in these kinds of scenarios.
            <br>
            If you want to know what is classification and other such algorithms you can refer here. <br><br>



            Naive Bayes is a machine learning model that is used for large volumes of data, even if you are working with
            <br>
            data that has millions of data records the recommended approach is Naive Bayes. It gives very good results
            <br>
            when it comes to NLP tasks such as sentimental analysis. It is a fast and uncomplicated classification <br>
            algorithm. <br><br>



            To understand the naive Bayes classifier we need to understand the Bayes theorem. So let’s first discuss the
            <br>
            Bayes Theorem.
